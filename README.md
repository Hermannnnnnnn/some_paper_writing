# About: technical setup
This section is just for myself or any other technical person that has no prior experience developing html.

I worked in Visual Studio Code: 
- to preview html's I used the extension *HTML Preview*.
- to compile scss into css (needed for the html to render) I used *Live Sass Compiler*. This extension adds a *Wath Sass* toggle switch on the bottom in VSCcode; if switched on, it will compile your scss file automatically.
- For some help in formatting SCSS I used the extension *SCSS Formatter*.
